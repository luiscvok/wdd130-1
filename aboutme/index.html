        <h2>Sir Luis</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone. I'm Luis Cornejo Vargas, from Temuco, Chile. I've been a language teacher for more than 32 years, and I love it. I have learnt from the experience that we are responsible for an integral education to our students.</p>
        <p>One of the most important decisions I have made in my life was to listen to the elders, ask God about the truth and get baptized to the Church of Christ.</p>
        <p>I have been happily married for almost 33 years, and sealed for 32. We have 3 wonderful children who love their Heavenly Father and their Savior, the Lord Jesuchrist.</p>
        <p>I'm really happy to be studying in BYU pathway and now BYU Idaho. I enrolled myself in this inspired programme after a lot of prayers asking God how to become a real disciple of my Savior.</p>
        <p>Thanks for looking at my web.page</p>
